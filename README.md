# Projects
This repository houses the projects I have developed throughout my academic journey in computer engineering, alongside personal undertakings.

Python
- [Artificial Intelligence - Classical, Temporal and Robotics Planning](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/artificialIntelligenceProject/)
The project models a problem domain for a system based on autonomous agents to which classic planning, time planning and robotic planning are then applied. The scenario represents a problem of logistic organization in which a number of injured people must be reached by emergency services, which can transport various objects.
- [Computer vision - Cable and towers segmentation](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/computerVisionProject/tree/main)
The project trains a Mask R-CNN to identify power cables within aerial photographs after a process of copy-paste data augmentation.
- [Big Data - American Flights](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/bigData)
The project features a Python-based interface, where data processing is facilitated through the Streamlit library. This enables the visualization of information extracted from a vast dataset concerning air flights, which required pecific big data techniques.
- [Data Mining - Fraudulent activities](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/dataMining)
This project performs anomaly detection on a dataset of banking transactions to identify potential fraudulent activities.
- [Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/cloudComputingProject)
The aim of the project was to develop an online interface employing Docker, enabling users to submit datasets for the application of frequent itemset mining algorithms
- [OOP - Polynomial simplificator](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/calcolatorePolinomiProject)
Java-based project to facilitate polynomial simplification.
- [OOP - BigInt](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/bigIntProject)
Java-based project to manage large integer numbers in the Java programming language.
- [OOP - Expression evaluator](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/valutaEspressioneProject)
Java-based project to perform evaluation of arithmetic expressions, including parentheses.
- [OOP - Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/alberoBinarioDiRicercaProject)
Java-based project to manage a binary search tree.
- [OOP - Sudoku](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/sudokuProject)
Java-based project implementing an emulator of the Sudoku game, incorporating the concept of backtracking.

Matlab & Maple
- [Fundamentals of automatic](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/automationProject)
The project entails the utilization of Maple and Matlab for the analysis of a linear and time-invariant continuous-time system. Furthermore, it involves designing and discussing the Bode plot for a transfer function and determining a simple-structure controller for a feedback control scheme.

VHDL
- [Carry select](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/carrySelect.VHDLProject)
Implementation of a carry-select circuit using VHDL.
- [Pipeline](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/appunti/blob/e0571c682f588b6147e38bc18288747763bd2c2c/Relazione%20progetto%20pipeline.pdf)
Creation of a pipeline circuit using VHDL.

HTML
- [TEDx Static website](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/tedxcatanzaro)
The website was realized for the TEDx event in Catanzaro, Italy
