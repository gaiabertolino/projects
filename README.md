# Projects
This repository houses the projects I've developed throughout my academic journey in computer engineering, alongside personal undertakings.

Python
- [Big Data - American Flights](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/bigData)
The project features a Python-based interface, with data processing facilitated through the Streamlit library. This enables the visualization of information extracted from a vast dataset concerning air flights, necessitating the utilization of specific big data techniques.
- [OOP - Polynomial simplificator](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/calcolatorePolinomiProject)
A series of classes were implemented in Java language to facilitate polynomial simplification.
- [OOP - BigInt](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/bigIntProject)
A class hierarchy has been implemented to manage large integer numbers in the Java programming language.
- [OOP - Expression evaluator](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/valutaEspressioneProject)
A Java class has been created to implement the evaluation of arithmetic expressions, including parentheses.
- [OOP - Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/alberoBinarioDiRicercaProject)
A Java class to manage a binary search tree.
- [OOP - Sudoku](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/sudokuProject)
An emulator of the Sudoku game has been created utilizing the Java programming language, incorporating the concept of backtracking.

Matlab & Maple
- [Fundamentals of automatic](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/automationProject)
The project entails the utilization of Maple and Matlab for the analysis of a linear and time-invariant continuous-time system. Furthermore, it involves designing and discussing the Bode plot for a transfer function and determining a simple-structure controller for a feedback control scheme.

VHDL
- [Carry select](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/carrySelect.VHDLProject)
The project has been developed as the final project of the course in Digital Electronics, offered in the third year of the Bachelor's degree program in Computer Engineering at the University of Calabria. It involves the implementation of a carry-select circuit using VHDL.
- [Pipeline](https://github.com/gaiabertolino/appunti/blob/e0571c682f588b6147e38bc18288747763bd2c2c/Relazione%20progetto%20pipeline.pdf)
The project was developed as the final project for the course in Digital Electronics, offered during the third year of the Bachelor's degree program in Computer Engineering at the University of Calabria. It involves the creation of a pipeline circuit using VHDL.
